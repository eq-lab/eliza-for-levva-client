Generate up to 5 suggestions for asset selection.
In case of "vault" strategy, suggest swap, eg. { "label": "Swap ETH(0.32 available) -> USDC", "text": "I want to Swap ETH to USDC" }
In case of "pool" strategy, suggest deposit, eg. { "label": "Deposit USDT(486.36 available)", "text": "I want to deposit USDT" }
"label" should display token symbol and balance if greater than 0, example: "ETH(0.32 available)" - with balance, "USDC" - without balance
"text" should include token symbol

ETH/WETH CONVERSION RULES:
- If user has ETH and strategy requires WETH, suggest: { "label": "Wrap ETH(0.32 available) -> WETH", "text": "I want to wrap ETH to WETH and deposit" }
- If user has WETH and wants to use ETH, suggest: { "label": "Unwrap WETH(0.5 available) -> ETH", "text": "I want to unwrap WETH to ETH" }
- ETH and WETH are interchangeable through wrapping/unwrapping (1:1 ratio)
- Consider both ETH and WETH options when user has either token

IMPORTANT ORDERING RULES:
- First prefer tokens with higher balance in portfolio
- Include ETH/WETH conversion suggestions when relevant
- Second include base token of pool
- Tokens with no balance should be included afterwards

Look at user's portfolio for selected token balance and remember it as MAX amount.
Consider MAX as 0 if token is not in portfolio.
If MAX amount is 0: 
- Suggest other tokens instead, up to 4 suggestions.
- Example for "pool" strategy: { label: "Deposit USDT(486.36 available)", text: "I want to deposit USDT" }
- Example for "vault" strategy: { label: "Swap ETH(0.32 available) -> USDC", text: "I want to Swap ETH to USDC" }
If MAX amount above 0:
- If token is native decrease MAX amount by 5%
- Display 4 suggestions, start with MAX amount and decrease each consecutively by 30%, like [MAX, MAX * 0.7, MAX * 0.4, MAX * 0.1]
ONLY in case of "pool" strategy: add 2 additional suggestions to either decrease or increase leverage in range of 1-20x
IMPORTANT ORDERING RULES:
- First display tokens with higher balance in portfolio
- Additional suggestions(if any) should be added after main suggestions
