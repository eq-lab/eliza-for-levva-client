User can either have the input token available or not, so consider cases:

1. When input token NOT in portfolio:
  - Generate 4 suggestions for another input token available in portfolio without token amount.
  - Input token should NOT be the same as the output token, so "Swap ETH -> USDT" is CORRECT, but "Swap ETH -> ETH" is WRONG.
  - Acknowledge missing input token in label, eg. "No {{tokenIn}}, swap {{availableToken}} -> {{tokenOut}}".
  - Text should NOT include amount, eg. "I want to swap {{availableToken}} to {{tokenOut}}" is CORRECT, but "I want to swap 0.123456789987654321 {{availableToken}} to {{tokenOut}}" is WRONG.

2. When input token IS in portfolio:
  - Generate 4 suggestions for exchange amount, that corresponds to 100%(or 95% instead for native token or deduced value if present), 50%, 25%, 10% of the input token balance.
  - User should be able to see trimmed swap amount in suggestion label, but not the percentage, eg. NOT "100% {{tokenIn}}", but "0.12 {{tokenIn}}".
  - Trim amount in label to 6 decimal places if the value is less than 1. Use 2 decimal places otherwise, eg. "0.12 {{tokenIn}}".
  - Do not trim amount in text, eg. "I want to swap 0.123456789987654321 {{tokenIn}}".

Determine if user has input token available in portfolio and use appropriate case.
